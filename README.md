# cgpacalc
A Calculator which will help you calculate your CGPA according to the CBSE marking.
Download all the files and extract them to a folder.
Then run CGPACalc.exe. 
Then follow the instructions to find out your CGPA. 
This project has been made using python and you are requested to run only the files that I am asking you to run.
This project is completely Virus-free.
Also, you only get to know your CGPA if you have a complete data of marks with you.
The software will be updated regularly if you want it to be updated.
Additional subjects (like Home Science, IT) are still not added in this project.
Subjects which may upgrade your grade are also not present, so upgradation is not mentioned in this app
Please download this app and ask your friends to the same. I would be very thankful to you if you do so.
